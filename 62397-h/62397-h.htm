ADDRESS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Society</span>:</p>

<p>It is no small privilege which the North Carolina
Society of the Cincinnati enjoys when it meets in this
ancient Revolutionary capital, for here our organization
was first brought into being. The year of grace
1783, which is the date of its birth, was one of mingled
joy and depression to the people of America. The
war, it is true, had been fought to a successful close;
and, by a treaty wherein they were separately specified,
King George had acknowledged the thirteen colonies
to be &#8220;free, sovereign, and independent States.&#8221;
But how changed was the order of things! The desolation
following in the wake of war was scarcely less
terrible than war itself, and no State had made greater
sacrifices for the cause of liberty than North Carolina.
Under daring partisan leaders at home, under Washington
in the north, and Greene in the south, her sons
had in countless fights lengthened the list of killed
and wounded, while those who were spared came home
to prove that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Peace hath her victories</div>
<div class="verse">No less renown&#8217;d than war.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yet many, so many, there were of the brave defenders
of America who did not return, and their mortal
remains still rest on and about the old battlefields
made memorable by their valor. To this class belonged
the good and gallant officer of whom I shall
speak today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Edward Buncombe</span>, of Buncombe Hall,
in the Colony of North Carolina, was born in the year
1742, on the Island of St. Christopher, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
called St. Kitt&#8217;s, which is one of the Leeward group
in the West Indies. The register of St. Ann&#8217;s Parish,
in the above island, shows that: &#8220;Edward, son of
Thomas and Esther Buncombe,&#8221; was baptized on the
23d of September in the above year.</p>

<p>Thomas Buncombe, the father of Edward, was a
gentleman of English birth and ancestry, and died in
the Fall of 1747. He had four children: John, Edward
(of whom this sketch treats), Sarah, who married first
a Mr. Beach and then a Mr. Humbergen, and Ann,
who married a Mr. Caines.</p>

<p>Joseph Buncombe, a brother of Thomas, and hence
an uncle of Edward, lived for a time in North Carolina
and married Ann, a daughter of George Durant;
but he is said to have died while absent from the colony
on a visit to relatives. When in North Carolina,
his home was in what is now the county of Washington
(then a part of Tyrrell), where he owned a valuable
estate. He probably died childless, for his property
was bequeathed by him to his nephew. The latter,
upon viewing the lands in Tyrrell, was so well pleased
with them that he disposed of his West Indian possessions
and settled permanently in North Carolina
about the year 1768. Shortly after this, the mansion
known as Buncombe Hall was erected on the site of
his uncle&#8217;s former residence.</p>

<p>Buncombe Hall lay about twelve miles south of
Edenton, across Albemarle Sound. At present a small
hamlet called Chesson, in Washington County, marks
the place where it stood. It was famed throughout
the colony as a seat of boundless hospitality. Over
an arched gateway, through which the grounds were
entered, was inscribed the couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Welcome all,</div>
<div class="verse">To Buncombe Hall.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Not only North Carolinians, but travellers in general,
frequently sought shelter there (for it was on a
road largely used), and a warm reception awaited each
visitor. In 1773, when Josiah Quincey, of Massachusetts,
was returning from a southern tour, he made
this entry in his Diary,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> while at New Bern, on the
2d of April: &#8220;Judge Howard waited upon me in the
evening with recommendatory letters to Colonel
Palmer of Bath, and Colonel Buncombe of Tyrrell
County.&#8221; Referring to April 5, he says: &#8220;Breakfasted
with Colonel Buncombe who waited upon me
to Edenton Sound, and gave me letters to his friends
there. Spent this and the next day in crossing Albemarle
Sound and in dining and conversing in company
with the most celebrated lawyers of Edenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not long after his arrival in North Carolina, Colonel
Buncombe was made a magistrate, and served as one
of the Justices of the Inferior Court of Tyrrell County.
He seems to have been very punctual in the discharge
of his official duties; for, in a letter written on November
29, 1771, by Thomas Jones to Sir Nathaniel Dukinfield,
a member of the Governor&#8217;s Council, the former
says that at a recent court Colonel Buncombe
and John McKildoe were the only members present.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
Mr. Jones adds: &#8220;The people attended with becoming
decency and patience but at length grew clamorous,
damn&#8217;d the absent Justices (I think with propriety),
and then prevailed upon McKildoe to adjourn court.&#8221;</p>

<p>In August, 1892, the centennial of Buncombe County,
North Carolina, was celebrated at Asheville, the county-seat.
At that time a sketch of Colonel Buncombe,
written by one of his descendants, Mrs. Walter H.
Rogers (born Goelet), of New Orleans, appeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<i>Asheville Citizen</i>, and from it we extract the following
concerning his residence: &#8220;Buncombe Hall, like its
founder, has passed away. It remained in the family
till after the last war. Ere we quit the subject, let me
describe this historic spot. The main building, L shape,
contained eight large rooms, and a four-room basement
under the whole, which served as store-rooms and a
kitchen. The brick used in the building was brought
from England. All necessary out-houses, including
offices, were upon the premises. The yard was filled
on one side with the most beautiful flowers and evergreens;
on the other, with fine trees and velvety
grass. To the south, stretched away a large peach
and apple orchard&mdash;the whole surrounded by broad
fields under cultivation, set in a back-ground of forests.
Here the contemplative mind might revel in
historic thought. The old hall, with its lofty ceilings,
high oak panels, and chimney casings, seemed to whisper
secrets of revolutionary times. Over the door of
the dining-room hung the coat-of-arms of the Goelet
family (a rising swan on a helmet); and, on the walls,
were family portraits of Colonel Buncombe, his sister
Mrs. Caines and her little daughter.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> On a closet door
still remained traces of sealing wax, used by the Colonel
in sealing up his silver plate and valuables when
he went to the war&mdash;vain precaution! His agent, left
in charge, turned Tory, robbed him of not only the
contents of this closet, but sold off his slaves and valuable
timber and then decamped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after the fall of Roanoke Island, the Federal
soldiers took possession of Plymouth. Then Buncombe
Hall fell a prey to them, as Dr. Edward Buncombe
Haughton, its owner, was fighting on the Confederate
side. He returned after the war, bankrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in purse, as all good Southerners were, and the old
hall was sold to a Connecticut carpet-bagger. It could
even then have been restored to its former greatness,
but he razed it to the ground and did not leave a
brick standing. It passed, again, out of his possession.
The Southern Goelets, all descendants of Colonel
Buncombe, were left too poor by the war to rescue
his home from annihilation; and so passed away, and
was wantonly destroyed, Buncombe Hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before proceeding with my narrative, justice requires
that acknowledgement be made to Mrs. Rogers, not
only for the above quoted passages, but also for the
letters hereinafter given, and other items relative to
the family connection of her distinguished ancestor.</p>

<p>There are now nine localities in the United States
called Buncombe, most (if not all) of which derive the
name either directly or indirectly from Colonel Buncombe.
They are: Buncombe County, North Carolina;
Buncombe, in Johnson County, Illinois; Buncombe,
in Dubuque County, Iowa&mdash;and Buncombe
Township, in Sioux County, in the same State; Buncombe,
in Union County, Mississippi; Buncombe, in
Lafayette County, Wisconsin; Buncombe Ridge, in
Lawrence County, Arkansas; Buncombe, in Knott
County, Kentucky; and Buncombe, in Jackson County,
Oregon.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;buncombe&#8221;&mdash;which dictionaries give as
signifying a bombastic utterance, usually employed
in windy harangues to gain popular favor&mdash;had its
origin through the following circumstance: In the
Congress of the United States, between the years 1817
and 1823, the mountain district of North Carolina was
represented by the Honorable Felix Walker many of
whose constituents were denizens of the now famous
county of Buncombe. One day, as Mr. Walker sat
pondering over his past political career, he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that during that session he had made very few
speeches&mdash;and this, by the way, was almost as rare a
fault with Congressmen in those days as it is now. So
he decided to speak; he did speak; he spoke at considerable
length; and he didn&#8217;t have anything particular
to say, but he kept on talking, nevertheless.
And when, at last, patience had ceased to be a virtue,
and some of his long-suffering colleagues were beginning
to leave the hall, he told the more polite members
who remained that they might go, too, if they wished,
for he intended to have his remarks published and
sent to the home people, as the speech was not intended
for the House, but <i>only for Buncombe</i>!</p>

<p>But to return to Colonel Edward Buncombe. He
received his education in Great Britain; and, while
living in St. Christopher, was united in marriage
(April 10, 1766,) with Elizabeth Dawson Taylor, who
accompanied him to North Carolina, but died just
prior to the outbreak of the Revolution. She and
her son Thomas are buried under St. Paul&#8217;s Church,
at Edenton. The children of Colonel Buncombe by
his marriage with Miss Taylor were:</p>

<p>I. Elizabeth Taylor Buncombe, born on the Island
of St. Christopher, March 11, 1767, who was brought
when an infant to North Carolina. Her education
was received in New York and New Jersey, under the
direction of Abraham Lott. She married John Goelet,
of New York (afterwards of North Carolina), and left
numerous descendants.</p>

<p>II. Thomas Buncombe, born in North Carolina,
February 3, 1769, who died young.</p>

<p>III. Hester Ann Buncombe, born April 25, 1771,
who married John Clark, of Bertie County, North
Carolina, and had two children: Thomas Clark, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Ann Booth Pollock Clark (wife of John Cox).<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Both
Thomas Clark and his sister Mrs. Cox died without
issue.</p>

<p>From the above it will be seen that the only descendants
now living of Colonel Buncombe are through
his eldest daughter who married John Goelet, of New
York. Mr. Goelet was of Huguenot descent, born in
1759, on the date of the fall of Quebec, and himself
saw service in the Revolution. After the war was over
and he had married Miss Buncombe, he removed with
his wife (about 1791) to Buncombe Hall, and died there
in the ninety-fifth year of his age, October, 1853.</p>

<p>In the sketch by Mrs. Rogers, heretofore quoted,
she says: &#8220;With the death of Colonel Buncombe,
the name died in this country, though his patriotic
spirit survived, he having eight great-grandsons who
volunteered in the Confederate army, one of whom,
John Buncombe Goelet, died on Malvern Hill in
defence of Richmond, Virginia. He was color-bearer
of the Third Alabama Regiment, and belonged to
Company A, Mobile Cadets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prior to the Revolution, Colonel Buncombe held a
commission in the military establishment of the
colony. He commanded a regiment of the provincial
troops of North Carolina, in the county of Tyrrell.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
Like nearly all of the better element of North Carolinians&mdash;such
men as Robert Howe, Richard Caswell,
Francis Nash, Thomas Polk, Alexander Lillington,
Griffith Rutherford, and others who afterwards won
fame in the Revolution&mdash;he used every effort to aid
Governor Tryon in suppressing the excesses and riots
of the Regulators, and received the official thanks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
His Excellency for the &#8220;truly public spirit&#8221; displayed
by him in the prosecution of this work. He did not,
however personally participate in the Alamance campaign,
as the regiments of his section of the colony
were not called into active service.</p>

<p>In religion, Colonel Buncombe was a member of the
Church of England, and, when he left the West Indies,
a chaplain is said to have accompanied his household
to North Carolina.</p>

<p>In the several years preceding the outbreak of the
Revolution, the patriots of North Carolina were boldly
preparing for any emergency which might arise. As
early as April 26, 1774, William Hooper had asserted
in a letter addressed to Judge Iredell, that the colonies
were &#8220;striding fast to independence, and ere long
would build an empire upon the ruins of Great Britain;
would adopt its constitution purged of its impurities,
and from an experience of its defects guard against
those evils which had wasted its vigor and brought it
to an untimely end.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> These were troublous times&mdash;times
calling for men of high purpose and courageous
bearing, who, in the face of King, Parliament and
Royal Governor, would boldly contend for the rights
which were as dear to them as to the people of England.
Nor was courage alone sufficient to cope with
King George&#8217;s representatives in Carolina. Political
dexterity played no small part in the controversies of
that day. Some years prior to the time of which we
treat, when the British Parliament passed the Stamp
Act, more resistance, and armed resistance, too, was
encountered in North Carolina than anywhere else.
But no resistance came from the Assembly, for Governor
Tryon prorogued that body to prevent official
action. This prorogation also prevented the Assembly
from later electing delegates to what is known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Stamp Act Congress. Tryon&#8217;s trickery worked so
well that his successor, Governor Josiah Martin,
decided to play a similar game in 1774. A controversy
arising over the laws establishing courts in the colony,
and the King&#8217;s instructions being at variance with the
ideas of the Assembly, that body refused to yield; and
Governor Martin thereupon put a stop to proceedings
by proroguing it. He also determined not to re-convene
it until the members were more inclined to obey
the royal will. This latter purpose being divulged
by the governor&#8217;s private secretary to John Harvey,
that bold statesman determined that an independent
assembly, or convention, should be called. He left
New Bern, the seat of government, and, on the third
of April, discussed the matter with Willie Jones.
The night following found him at Buncombe Hall, in
the county of Tyrrell. At this place Mr. Harvey
confided his plan to Samuel Johnston and Colonel
Buncombe.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> These notables were impressed with the
gravity of the situation, and the night was far spent
ere their consultation came to an end. Referring to
this conference, in his History of North Carolina,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
Moore says: &#8220;Buncombe was impulsive and impressionable,
but Johnston was the embodiment of caution
and deliberation. He was full of determination
to resist Lord North&#8217;s measures, but he feared the
effects of too much popular power. These eminent
men, with Hooper, John Ashe, Caswell, Person, and
others, at once acceded to Harvey&#8217;s proposition, and
the ball of the Revolution was put in motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite Governor Martin&#8217;s frantic proclamation forbidding
its meeting, the independent convention
gathered in New Bern on the 25th of August, 1774.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
No assembly of its kind had ever before convened in
America. It was followed by others of like character.
Delegates to the Continental Congress were elected.
The breach with Great Britain became wider, and
finally, as a last resort, independence was declared.
And it may be well just here to observe that North
Carolina was the very first colony to authorize a
national declaration of independence, when in the
Provincial or State Congress at Halifax on April 12,
1776, Cornelius Harnett submitted a committee report
(which was unanimously adopted), setting forth a
resolution: &#8220;that the delegates for this colony in the
Continental Congress be impowered to concur with the
delegates of the other colonies in <i>declaring independency</i>.&#8221;
This was more than a month before the passage
of the famous Virginia resolutions; and even those
who question the genuineness of the Mecklenburg
Declaration of Independence have never attempted
to disprove the authenticity of this resolution adopted
by the Provincial Congress at Halifax. So North
Carolina will ever claim the proud distinction of having
been first to move for independence, as she was also
first to offer resistance to the Stamp Act. The preamble
to the above resolve in favor of independence is a
masterly vindication of the course pursued by the
colonies, and should be read of all men.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>As well may be supposed, a man of Colonel Buncombe&#8217;s
spirit and patriotism was not the person to hold
back from participation in a war, however perilous,
which he himself had been instrumental in bringing
about. On September 9, 1775, he was elected Colonel
of the militia forces of Tyrrell County<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> by the Provincial
Congress of North Carolina, then in session at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Halifax. He fulfilled the duties of this position for
about seven months, and, on the 17th of April, 1776,
was transferred to the regular service, being made
Colonel of the Fifth Regiment of North Carolina
troops in the Continental Line.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> During the period
intervening between its organization and the time
when ordered to the field, the Fifth Regiment was
maintained at his private expense. On May 7, 1776,
the appointment of Colonel Buncombe was confirmed
by the Continental Congress,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> and his regiment was
assigned to General Francis Nash&#8217;s brigade. This
brigade was made up at Wilmington, North Carolina,
in the Summer of 1776, and remained in that vicinity
till November of the same year. Having been ordered
to join Washington&#8217;s army, then operating in the
north, General Nash and his troops set out from Wilmington
about the 15th of November, and, on reaching
the town of Halifax, were ordered back south, the
object being to keep the British from entering Georgia
by way of St. Augustine. No sooner, however, had
Charleston been reached, than orders were again countermanded.
Thereupon the brigade marched to Haddrell&#8217;s
Point, opposite Fort Sullivan, South Carolina,
at which place it remained in the forces which were
there opposing the operations of Sir Henry Clinton.
In March, 1777, orders were again given the North Carolina
brigade to join Washington. Moving up through
North Carolina and Virginia, and crossing the Potomac
near Alexandria, the main army was finally
reached on the Jersey side of the Delaware River, at
Middlebrook. The accession of these brave North
Carolinians was gladly hailed by Washington, and
they were given a thundering welcome in the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&#8220;a salutation of thirteen cannon, each fired thirteen
times.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>



<p>At Alexandria, in the latter part of May, the march
of Nash&#8217;s brigade had been delayed to inoculate the
troops against small-pox.</p>

<p>Early in July, the North Carolinians, together with
the other troops around Philadelphia, were detailed
to complete the fortifications on the Delaware River.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th of August, 1777, while the Continental
forces were in camp at Trenton, we find Colonel Buncombe
and the other field-officers of Nash&#8217;s brigade
uniting in a protest against a Pennsylvanian, Colonel
Edward Hand, being made a brigadier-general to command
North Carolina troops, <i>vice</i> General James
Moore, who had recently died.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> While not questioning
Colonel Hand&#8217;s merit, they declared that the appointment
of any outsider would be a &#8220;reflection on
North Carolina and a stab at military honour throughout
the continent in general.&#8221; The memorial also
contained some rather unpleasant references to Thomas
Burke (then a delegate from North Carolina in the
Continental Congress), and charged him with neglecting
the interests of the State he represented to advance
one of his own countrymen&mdash;he and Hand both being
natives of Ireland. Burke was so enraged thereby
that he declared, referring to the signers of the protest:
&#8220;Their behaviour in this instance has determined
me to forego all particular attention to them. I hope
they will so distinguish themselves that their merit
alone will be sufficient for their promotion, without
standing in need of any assistance which I could give.&#8221;
Whether Doctor Burke did forego all particular attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to the North Carolinians does not appear,
but he certainly succeeded in his efforts to secure the
promotion of Hand, who, it is a pleasure to add, rendered
long and honorable service during the war, and
held a major-general&#8217;s commission in the regular army
after the return of peace.</p>

<p>On the 11th day of September, 1777, was fought the
battle of Brandywine, and here Colonel Buncombe&#8217;s
regiment was actively engaged. In this conflict, the
North Carolina brigade and Greene&#8217;s division were
ranged in the centre of the American Army.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> Being
ordered to support the right wing (then sorely pressed),
their absence left the troops under General Wayne to
cope alone with a vastly superior force of the enemy.
After a brave and bloody resistance, Wayne was
forced to retire, and the day was lost.</p>

<p>After his reverses at Brandywine, the never-despairing
Washington drew together his forces and prepared
again to attack. He was, in truth, a leader whom no
disaster could appall.</p>

<p>The next scene of action was at Germantown, Pennsylvania.
This fight occurred on the 4th of October,
and was destined to be Colonel Buncombe&#8217;s last battle,
for there he received the wound which ultimately
caused his death while a prisoner in the hands of the
British. The brigade of North Carolinians was selected
by the commander-in-chief to act as a part of the
reserve corps at Germantown, but it may be questioned
if it would have suffered more terribly if placed in the
van. The brave General Nash, with his thigh shattered
by a solid shot,<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> and fainting from the loss of
blood, was borne to a near-by house and lingered only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
three days. Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Irwin of Buncombe&#8217;s
regiment (the Fifth), Captain Jacob Turner
of the Third, and Lieutenant John McCann of the
Sixth North Carolina, lay dead on the field. Major
William Polk of the Ninth, received a shot in the
face, which, for a time, deprived him of the power
of speech. Captain John Armstrong of the Second,
Lieutenant Joshua Hadley of the Sixth, and Ensign
John Daves of the Second, were also among the
wounded, as were doubtless many others, of whom,
unfortunately, we have now no record.</p>

<p>And the privates! How many of those forgotten
heroes shed their blood and gave up their lives, as
freely as did the officers, will never be known. May
their devotion be rewarded in a better world.</p>

<p>When struck down on the field of Germantown,
Colonel Buncombe was left for dead by the retreating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Americans and lay where he fell until the next day,
when a British officer recognized him as an old schoolmate
and had him removed to Philadelphia. There he
was paroled within the city limits. His wound at first
yielded to treatment, and it was thought he would
recover. But as life dragged on, he realized that the
weakened state of his constitution could not longer
withstand continued privation. Being in great financial
straits, and his physical condition growing worse day
by day, he at last applied to Sir William Howe, the
British commandant of Philadelphia, for leave to go as
a paroled prisoner either to England or to North Carolina;
but, if this request was ever granted, he did not
avail himself of the privilege. Fearing that the motives
which prompted his application had been misconstrued,
he addressed to General Washington a letter,
the original of which is now in possession of the Goelet
family, Washington having returned it to one of that
connection, after the Revolution, as a memorial of its
brave author. Following is the communication in
full:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>

<p>As I deem myself accountable to you, as my General, for every part
of my conduct, permit this letter to speak what in person I cannot
deliver.</p>

<p>Distressed I have been, repeatedly soliciting a supply of money
from camp, yet hitherto I have not been obliged. I never was accustomed
to adversity. Let the feelings of Your Excellency&#8217;s heart
speak for me.</p>

<p>It is true I have my failings. Human nature will operate no perfection.
But, as an officer, have I in any shape or respect disgraced my
regiment? Have I not been anxious to fight for America? Can one
of Your Excellency&#8217;s officers accuse me of cowardice?</p>

<p>Prompted by my distress, I was inevitably compelled to apply to
His Excellency General Sir William Howe either for a parole to the
southward or to Britain. Here I cannot command hard money;
there I can.</p>

<p>The exigency of my case, I am persuaded, will point out the expediency
of my adopted measure. I request that you will not think my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
departure from America a desertion of it. Always amenable to my
General&#8217;s call, in six months I shall be ready to obey your orders if
you think proper to have me exchanged.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, with sincerity, Your Excellency&#8217;s</p>

<p class="indentleft5">Very respectful and obed&#8217;t serv&#8217;t,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">E. Buncombe</span>.</p>

<p>To<br />
<span class="indentleft1">His Excellency</span><br />
<span class="indentleft3">General Washington,</span><br />
<span class="indentleft5">Commander-in-Chief</span><br />
<span class="indentleft7">of the Forces of the United Colonies.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The unfortunate captive, by whom this letter was
written, never lived to enjoy the freedom he so much
loved. He was, at times, addicted to somnambulism;
and about the middle of May, 1778, while walking in
his sleep, fell down a flight of stairs. This accident
caused his wound to open afresh; and, before assistance
could avail, he bled to death.</p>

<p>Thus passed the spirit of Edward Buncombe, soldier
and gentleman&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">&#8220;Than whom, knight</div>
<div class="verse">Was never dubbed, more bold in fight;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor, when from war and armor free,</div>
<div class="verse">More famed for stately courtesy.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And when they buried him, an entry was made on
the parish-register of Christ Church, Philadelphia,
noting the interment of <i>Cornelius</i> Buncombe; while
many North Carolina historians, in later years, have
given his first name as Richard! This consideration
for his memory brings to mind Byron&#8217;s remark on
reading of the death, at Waterloo, of an old college-mate:
&#8220;There is fame! A man is killed. His name
is Grose, and they print it Grove.&#8221;</p>

<p>The death of Colonel Buncombe occurred at the
house of a Mrs. Kendall. This we learn from a letter
written on July 22, 1778, by Thomas Franklin, a Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Quaker, to General Benedict Arnold (then
in the American service), giving a list of Buncombe&#8217;s
effects, &#8220;left in ye hands of ye widow Edy Kendall,
where he lodged last and died.&#8221;</p>

<p>During Colonel Buncombe&#8217;s service in the army, he
was accompanied by a faithful slave, Charles, and to
this negro he bequeathed freedom. The following
reference to him is found in a letter from the Reverend
Adam Boyd, Brigade-Chaplain in the North Carolina
Line, dated in camp, at White Plains, New York,
August 24, 1778: &#8220;Charles, I believe is entitled to his
freedom. The Colonel has often been heard to say he
should not serve anyone after his death; and some of
his officers have heard him say he had, in his will,
ordered him his freedom. A law of our State forbids
such emancipation without the consent of the court
of that county in which the master usually resides.
But an appeal to that law in this case I do not think
would be right, because it would defeat the testator&#8217;s
intention, which I think should be held sacred. Though
I think it would be easy for his heirs, should they
avail themselves of the law, to enslave Charles for life,
I hope such a thing will not be attempted. The principal
object of this law was to prevent the discharge
of slaves that were not able to earn their living&mdash;a
cruel practice which had scandalously prevailed to
avoid paying taxes, from which old age or other infirmities
do not exempt slaves.&#8221; The will, by which
Charles was supposed to be emancipated, could not
be found among Colonel Buncombe&#8217;s papers, but the
negro was allowed to go free in deference to his late
owner&#8217;s expressed wish. The only will found was one
which had been made before the war.</p>

<p>The spot where Colonel Buncombe lies buried is not
marked, but it is somewhere within the &#8220;additional
church-yard&#8221; of the parish of Christ Church, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
corner of Arch and Fifth Streets, Philadelphia. In
this enclosure are also deposited the remains of Benjamin
Franklin, and other patriots; while not many
miles off sleep Nash, Irwin, Turner, McCann, and
their brave comrades, who counted not life above liberty.
And North Carolina should little grieve that
her sons are left on the soil of Pennsylvania. There
they fell, fighting for the common cause of America;
there let them rest.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The neighing troop, the flashing blade,</div>
<div class="indent">The bugle&#8217;s stirring blast,</div>
<div class="verse">The charge, the dreadful cannonade,</div>
<div class="indent">The din and shout are past;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor war&#8217;s wild note nor glory&#8217;s peal</div>
<div class="indent">Shall thrill with fierce delight</div>
<div class="verse">Those breasts that nevermore may feel</div>
<div class="indent">The rapture of the fight.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As a grateful tribute to the memory of Colonel Buncombe,
the General Assembly of North Carolina, at
its session of 1791, created a new county just westward
of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and called it in his
honor. This is a monument which will stand when
the proudest memorials of our day have become misshapen
masses of stone. For ages it will tell of the
brave soldier who fought for his country&#8217;s freedom
and now sleeps in a forgotten grave, awaiting the last
summons when the earth and the sea shall give up
their dead. Peaceful be his rest!&mdash;and may generations
yet to come draw inspiration from the life he led.</p>

Dr. Richard B. Haywood, that Col. William Polk said that Gen. Nash received his
mortal wound from a shot through the eyes. That Col. Polk also made this statement
to persons other than Dr. Haywood appears in Dr. W. M. Polk&#8217;s biography
of Bishop Polk (I. 27), which quotes Col. Polk as saying Nash &#8220;was blind,&#8221; and
almost in syncope from loss of blood. Yet, strange as it may seem, though official
records show he was himself present and severely wounded at Germantown, Col.
Polk was mistaken in this, as will now be shown. John Penn, writing from near the
battlefield (on Oct. 10th) only three days after Nash&#8217;s death, says: &#8220;Poor General
Nash was killed by a cannon ball, with his horse.&#8221; An obituary published in the
<span class="smcap">North Carolina Gazette</span>, less than a month later (Oct. 31st), states: &#8220;The winged
Messenger of Death, a cannon ball, * * * * struck him on the thigh, tore his
body in a most dreadful manner, and killed his horse under him.&#8221; In the legislative
proceedings in honor of Gen. Nash (Nov. 19th), less than six weeks after his
death, it appears that he &#8220;received a wound from a cannon ball; and, after languishing
some days * * * * closed his useful life.&#8221; See State Records of North
Carolina, Vol. XI., pp. 649, 789; Ibid., Vol. XII., p. 279. Pennsylvania accounts
also say Nash was killed by a cannon ball which struck him on the thigh. The
statement by Col. Polk was made when he was a very old man, fifty years or more
after the battle; hence his mistake may have been caused by confusing Gen. Nash
with some other wounded officer at Germantown who may have been shot through
the eyes. Col. Polk&#8217;s second wife was a sister of Dr. Haywood&#8217;s mother.</p></div>
